# Admin Dashboard (Internship Assignment)

> A modern, responsive, and robust Admin Dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI. 
> Enhanced and optimized by **Bhagya**.

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-18.0.0-blue) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-Strict-blue)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated Admin Dashboard designed to manage users and roles efficiently. It leverages the power of **Material React Table (MRT)** for a dynamic data grid experience, **React Query** for efficient caching and synchronization, and **MSW** for seamless API mocking during development.

KEY FOCUS: Fixing intentional architectural bugs, optimizing performance, and ensuring production-grade type safety.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Grid**: High-performance table with sorting, filtering, and custom cell rendering.
- **Advanced State Management**: URL-synchronized pagination, search, and filters.
- **Optimized Performance**: Debounced search and efficient cache invalidation.
- **Smooth UX**: Loading skeletons and optimistic UI updates.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Custom error boundaries and user-friendly error messages.
- **Strict Type Safety**: Fully typed with TypeScript strict mode enabled.

## 🔧 Improvements & Fixes Implemented

This project started with intentional bugs and incomplete features. Here is a summary of the work done to bring it to a production-ready state:

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
1.  **Cache Invalidation**: Fixed `useUsers` hook to ensure the table refreshes automatically after a user status update.
2.  **Chiplist Renderer**: Repaired the "Groups" column renderer in `DynamicGrid` to correctly display group names as colored chips with icons.
3.  **URL Synchronization**: Implemented bidirectional sync between URL parameters and table state (pagination, filters, search) using `useSearchParams`.

### 🚀 Feature Enhancements
1.  **Debounced Search**: Implemented a custom `useDebounce` hook to optimize API calls.
2.  **Loading Skeletons**: Added a visual skeleton loader to `DynamicGrid` for better UX.
3.  **Enhanced Actions Column**:
    *   Added **hover states** for interactive feedback.
    *   Implemented a **confirmation dialog** before deactivating users to prevent accidental actions.
    *   Ensured **accessibility** with `aria-labels` and keyboard navigation support.
4.  **Robust Error Handling**:
    *   Integrated `ErrorBoundary` to catch and display user-friendly error messages.
    *   Added **retry mechanisms** for failed network requests.
5.  **Bonus Features Implemented**:
    *   **State Persistence (Bonus A)**: Column visibility and sorting preferences are saved to `localStorage`.
    *   **Unit Tests (Bonus B)**: Comprehensive testing for `useDebounce` hook and table rendering logic.
    *   **Role-Based UI (Bonus C)**: Visual indicators (badges/icons) based on user roles (Admin, Management).
6.  **Build Optimization**: Resolved TypeScript strict mode compilation errors.
